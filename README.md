 Italian with Greek Letters Keyboard layout for Windows

This repo contains the installer and the keyboard layout file for Windows defining an ITALIAN keyboard with Greek Letters, ideal for those programming languages that supports additional greek characters in code.
The thing has born for F#, OCaml and other ML functional languages whose lexers were among the first to support greek letters, expecially for expressing type variables in forms for α, β, γ in place of 'a, 'b, 'c. I personally find it useful for variable identifiers as well.
Feel free to update it to US or other layouts!
